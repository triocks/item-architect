# PF2E: Triocks Item Architect

**Architect**: Item Architect is a procedural forging hub for Pathfinder 2e. Designed for Game Masters who need precision and flexibility, this module allows you to build custom items from the ground up using a modular "Rule Element" engine. Whether you are crafting a simple +1 longsword or a complex artifact, you can stack detailed rules, runes, and materials to define exactly how an item behaves in the PF2e system.

**🛠 Features**
**Procedural Forging**: Generate base items that adhere strictly to PF2e math, levels, and rarity whitelists.

**Modular Rule Stacking:** Layer multiple properties, runes, and custom logic onto a single base item.

**Drafting UI**: A dedicated workspace to preview and "Architect" your items before committing them to your world.

**System Integration**: Built specifically for the PF2e system on Foundry VTT, utilizing native rule elements and fundamental rune progression.

**v13 Ready**: Fully optimized for the latest Foundry VTT environments using modern Vanilla JS.
